<p>Welcome to wherecanipark.in! Don't know how to interpret all those crazy signs as you try to figure out where you can park in Seattle? This app's for you!</p>
<p>Either search your current location or search for an address, then hit "Find parking!" and you'll get back a map with colored lines to tell you what category of parking you can find on your surrounding blockfaces. Be sure to check the legend and hints to make sure you're in the right spot at the right time!</p>

<p>This app is backed by data straight from the City of Seattle, providing you with up-to-date parking restrictions. This app is one of a kind for Seattle, and we hope to include other cities in the future as well. While the parking data is frequently updated by the City of Seattle, please remember that this app does not currently replace common sense. For example, if you see that parking on a street is unrestricted, you must still obey all laws such as not parking in front of fire hydrants or in loading zones. </p>
